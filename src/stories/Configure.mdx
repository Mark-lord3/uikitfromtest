# Configure your project

Storybook only renders the components that match the glob patterns declared in `.storybook/main.ts`.  
In this workspace we load:

- `../src/**/*.mdx` for documentation pages
- `../src/**/*.stories.@(ts|tsx)` for component stories

Keep your stories inside `src/stories` (or a child folder) and make sure the filename ends with `.stories.tsx`.

## Required exports

Every component story must provide a default export with a `title` and `component`.  
Each variation is a named export created from a template:

```tsx
export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Button>;

const Template: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = { label: 'Button' };
```

If the default export is missing or the title is empty Storybook hides the file silently.

## MDX docs

Webpack 4 + MDX v1 has limited syntax support. Stick to Markdown, standard JSX and components from `@storybook/addon-docs/blocks`.  
If a docs page fails to compile, either simplify it or temporarily rename it so you can continue working on your component stories.
